I tips about job interviews, but they generally give generic advide with no examples.

## Do the homework (and show it!)

- find the company website/linkedin and skim through their "/about" page
- make an effort to understand the product and some core company values
- with this information you can tailor your conversation with the interviewer

## Learn how to fill the silences

- there are natural silent moments in conversation
- this is a chance to ask a question about something you would like to address about your profile.
- perhaps you implemented one of their libs in a simple side project and you're insecure about your experience level, guide the conversation in a proactive manner:
  - how do you use graphql? I've never used graphql at this scale, mostly in smaller projects.
  - this gives you the opportunity to expose

## Be curious and ask questions

-

## Truth is the key!

Saying the truth is the key to a comfortable interview. Don't lie about your experience, don't lie about companies you worked at
