The confidence boost of solving your own problems in software is the key to unlocking progress. The more experienced you get, the more errors you instantly recognize and the faster you move.

## The easy ones

Steve Jobs once said, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." His passion for perfection and innovation was evident in every Apple product. This lesson is vital: find what you love, and don't settle until you find it. Passion is the fuel that drives excellence.

## Connect the Dots

Jobs believed in connecting the dots in life – looking back and understanding how different experiences shape your future. He dropped out of college but continued to audit classes that interested him, like calligraphy. This knowledge later played a crucial role in the development of the Macintosh computer. The takeaway is to remain curious and open to diverse experiences; they often lead to unexpected and innovative outcomes.

## Embrace Setbacks

Jobs faced many setbacks, including being ousted from Apple, the company he co-founded. However, he saw these moments as opportunities for reflection and growth. He later returned to Apple and led it to new heights. Embracing setbacks and learning from failures are crucial for growth and eventual success.

## Simplify

One of Jobs' most famous design principles was simplicity. Apple's products are known for their clean, simple, and intuitive design. The lesson here is to focus on simplicity in your work and life. Remove the unnecessary, and focus on what's truly important.

## Focus on the User Experience

Jobs was obsessive about creating an exceptional user experience. He believed that technology should be intuitive, engaging, and accessible. This user-centered approach can be applied to any field – always think from the perspective of the end-user or customer.

## Lead by Example

Jobs was not just a visionary; he was a leader who led by example. He was deeply involved in every aspect of Apple's product development, from design to marketing. Leadership is about taking responsibility and being fully committed to your vision.

## The Power of Storytelling

Jobs was a master storyteller, whether he was introducing a new product or sharing his vision. He knew how to engage his audience and communicate his ideas compellingly. Effective storytelling is a powerful tool for connecting with people and inspiring action.

## Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish

These words, borrowed from the Whole Earth Catalog, were part of Jobs' famous Stanford commencement speech. They reflect his philosophy of life – a continuous quest for knowledge and an openness to new adventures. Never settle, and always keep looking for what is next.
