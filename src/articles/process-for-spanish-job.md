title: "How I got a job in Spain"

Earlier this year, I flew to Italy from Brazil to visit my Dad for a couple of months. In that period, I also went to Málaga to see an old friend and the UK to see family.

A day before going home, I got an unexpected invite: my friend offered to live with him in Spain. I cancelled my flight back home. Two weeks later I was back in Málaga. For real, for real this time.

When I settled in, I realized that I had around a month to:

- Find a job that sponsored a visa, or
- Marry a European woman, or
- Exit Europe

Here is a timeline for one of the hiring processes I took part in with tips for every step

## Applying

For the first time in my life, I successfully applied to a position via LinkedIn Easy Apply. I shared my CV with the recruiter, she sent a message and we scheduled a talk for the following day.

> Tip: I usually search for positions posted in the last 24h.

## Recruiter Conversation

This was 30 minutes where we went over introductions, some questions such as "Talk a bit about yourself and your professional experience"

She asked how much experience I had with the stack (React, React Native, TypeScript and GraphQL). I mentioned that I had personal projects in production with TypeScript and React. Namely, my website [css2wind](https://css2wind.com).

> Tip: Ask a question. I default to "What is the size of the developer team?" or "What is the happy path for this hiring process?".

## Coding Assignment

After the meeting ended, she sent me a coding assignment:

- It was a React, Redux and Redux Toolkit codebase.
- It had only one commit, with (frankly) pretty terrible code. No linting, `var` everywhere, full of
- It became clear that part of the job was refactoring the code
- I was told to review the code as if it was a pull request from someone in my team.[Here is the code review](https://gist.github.com/LukeberryPi/2833f7f21e2cb102c43bc6406db17749).
- I was also asked to implement three features:
  - dkawdklaw
  - dkawdklaw 
  - dkawdklaw

This is what I delivered: Movieland, all your movies in one-place

> Tip: Take home projects are about prioritizing correctly. Make the basics work first, then iterate and refactor.
