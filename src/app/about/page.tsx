        <p>
          I was born in São Paulo and moved to{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis">
            Florianópolis
          </a>{" "}
          as a kid. I fell in love with the amazing nature, sport and music of
          the Magic Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next decade, I{" "}

            became a singer-songwriter
          </a>
          , got a Karate blue belt, won back-to-back Carnavals with a samba
          school and wasted thousands of hours playing League of Legends.
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied Economics at{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Santa_Catarina">
            Federal University of Santa Catarina
          </a>
          , which I chose for my love for History and Mathematics. I learned a
          lot of Politics, Statistics and Macroeconomics. But Economics is a
          field guilty of over-abstraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would spend months studying models that were far too simplified to
          be applicable in real-life. I felt really disconnected from my studies
          which led to me dropping out after 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first contact with programming was as a Data Analyst Intern at a
          Big Data startup. We used Microsoft Excel and Power BI to generate our
          reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          With millions of data entries, it wasn&apos;t long until my Dell
          notebook became unusable. This led me to learn Python, Pandas and
          Matplotlib to better deal with datasets. I also learned Selenium and
          pyautogui.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had always been obsessed with user interfaces. My friends
          couldn&apos;t bear me pointing out misplaced buttons, broken forms and
          ugly websites all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I found out what the underlying technologies where, I did a deep
          dive into Frontend Development. I completed FreeCodeCamp&apos;s{" "}
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">
            Responsive Web Design
          </a>{" "}
          and swiftly progressed to Javascript, and later, React.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became more active within the Brazilian Dev community, cataloguing
          UI bugs with{" "}
          <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%23berryux&src=typed_query&f=live">
            #berryux
          </a>{" "}
          and building <a href="https://phived.com">phived</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://css2wind.com">css2wind</a>. I learned more about Open
          Source and building in public, often building features with other
          developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2024, I travelled to Torino, Italy to visit my dad. My life flipped
          upside down and I ended up living in Málaga, Spain for a while. After
          I{" "}
          <a href="/articles/how-not-to-get-a-job-in-spain">
            failed to get a job
          </a>
          , I moved to the UK and landed a job in Bath, where I currently live.
